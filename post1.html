         <h2>1. Expertise</h2>
         <p>
            Real estate agents are experts in selling and buying homes. They know where the best properties are, they
            know how to
            negotiate to get a better quote, and they know which home features will get you the most bang for you buck.
         </p>

         <h2>2. Save Time</h2>
         <p>
            When it comes to buying or selling a home there is a lot of paperwork involved, negotiations to be made,
            contractors to
            hire, and much more.
            Without a real estate agent, youâ€™ll have to do the leg work finding homes that are on sale or finding buyers
            to sell to,
            negotiating offers, inspecting homes, and filing paperwork. This is on top of the busy life you already
            live.
            A real estate agent can do all of this for you, while you dream about your new home.

         </p>

         <h2>3. Professional Access</h2>
         <p>
            Real estate agents have access to professional resources that non-agents might not have access to. Real
            estate agents
            also have network of people that they trust. From home inspectors, contractors, and unlisted properties.
            Using a real
            estate agent is your key to getting high quality services.
